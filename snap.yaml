title: Another Simple But Efficient Audio Recorder (ASBEAR)
summary: 'A simple, but efficient audio recorder with an embedded player and a converter'
description: |
'   This audio recorder currently supports three codecs :
     - Vorbis (OGG) for high compression
     - FLAC for high quality, even compressed
     - Raw PCM (WAV) for high quality

    You can easily manage your recordings thanks to
    a user-friendly and quite comprehensive file manager.

    The converter allows you to switch between the listed below codecs
    mostly for lightening files.

    The GUI has two languages : English and French.
    And the most important thing : there is obviously a dark theme !'
